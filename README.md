There are still many colors that need to be cleaned and made uniform.

Willing to accept any and all contributions. I love the Nord theme and have been using it for everything so far. My love for the Visual Studio editor had me do this in my spare time. 

If there are issues, please feel free to log them. If you have a fix for them feel free to submit the fix.
